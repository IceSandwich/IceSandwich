I'm a computer vision engineer.
The programming languages i'm using:
1. C++ (primary, mostly use c++17, plan to make a game engine based on vulkan/directx)
2. Python (netrual network, blender plugin)
3. Golang (scripts, tools, crawler)
4. Typescript (GM scripts, Webpage dev with vue)
5. C# (to dev game in godot)
6. Java (mostly in android dev, just deploy nn models in mobile devices with native c++)
